# Attendance App
A simple attendance app

## Background & Requirements
My friend, a few days ago, told me to make an attendance app for his class.  
Requirements:  
* Login for admin(s)
* PWA
* Ability to add users
* Very easy selection of present students
* A bit of statistics/analysis
I knew it was a simple task, so I thought of doing it in a coding sprint. Sort of a mini hackathon.


## Preparation
* I have my heroku account set up
* My DB is set up
* A few projects for reference and copy pasta :smile:
* Lots of thinking

Its 8:30 pm, and I now begin. I have my laptop (with a mouse attached to it), paper and pen and a water bottle with me. (And obviously Google, SO, GitHub, etc to help me out)

Lets see how fast I can copy pasta and build a working system, according to the requirements!
Lets begin!

## Notes
* Dont delete a student on the last day. Delete it on the next day.
* Add users the first day they attend class. Not before that. Otherwise they will be marked absent
